          <li>Hereby, you understand that GoodGain is not a game developer and does not have any legal binding with any game developer; therefore, it does not hold responsibility for the game's technological issues or possible situations that may damage or prejudice your game experience. You are fully aware that GG is an online game-tournament manager, and all matches available are promoted, organized, and processed by game developers and held on their servers, and we do not have any legal binding, liability, or commercial relation with such companies. </li>
          <li>The user agrees that there are risks of losing money when using the services offered, and neither GG nor any other member of the company has any responsibility to you or your performance on skill-based games. It means they are not liable for any negative results on your games.</li>

You acknowledge that GG cannot provide any advice or offer help regarding taxes and fees required in your country of residence, except for Australian residents or users. That means you are solely responsible for any taxes applicable to sales or regarding the aggregate value of a purchase or award. </li>
          <li>The user acknowledges and agrees that opponents found through our platform are selected randomly by our automated algorithm. Not even GoodGain's team has the right or possibility to interfere in the bracket creation process for tournaments and championships. Accordingly, the user declares to have no right to make complaints regarding balance and match-making under any circumstances, regardless of how adverse and unfavorable they might be.</li>
          <li>The users declare that any service they hire for personal use, such as electricity and internet provision, is not part of GoodGain's remit. It means the users understand and declare that third party companies' quality of service provision is solely part of the users' responsibility. GoodGain will not refund any user for possible losses due to third-party services' flaws or impossibilities to function correctly. </li>
          <li>The user declares that all information provided in his registration for the GoodGain account is accurate and correct. </li>
          <li>The users understand and declare they are not unable or hindered by a local jurisdiction or geographical location to receive our prizes in the format of products or money as a reward for their performances in GoodGain competitions. </li>
          <li>In case any information the users have provided is confirmed as false, GoodGain reserves the right to end their accounts immediately and permanently prevent them from registering again or trying to access their accounts. Any account exclusion and banishment cannot be contested and is not open for a re-evaluation. </li>
          <li>The user declares and agrees that expenses regarding GoodGain service provision, such as tournament management, customer service, etc., are legitimate since they contribute to our platform to provide proper services back to the users.</li>
          <li>Our users understand and agree that any mistakenly deposited credit in their digital wallets or bank accounts do not belong to them, and they have no right to spend, transfer, or withdraw it. The users also commit themselves to transfer back the entire amount to GoodGain once our team has finished contacting them. Not transferring it back will be considered a breach of these terms, and the users who refuse to follow the agreement can be banned from our platform and notified by law on their jurisdiction.</li>
          </ul>
          <br/>
          <p className={classes.paragraph}>
          2. <strong>No warranties.</strong>
          </p>
          <ul style={{paddingLeft:23, lineHeight:'26px'}} className={classes.paragraph}>
          <li>GoodGain disclaims any warranties in connection with financial profitability or user performances once using our services. Our team is in charge of providing tournaments and other competition formats, but users' performances, regardless of their results, relies exclusively and solely on them.</li>
          <li>GoodGain makes no warranty that games will run appropriately during its competitions and disclaims all responsibility for any technical complication. The responsibility lies entirely on game developers and users who play their games and have agreed to their terms and policies. That means any losses occasioned by connection loss or game defects can't be associated with GoodGain since they are out of our range. Consequently, our team disclaims any warranties regarding the internet or game running defects or failures.</li>
          <li>GoodGain disclaims all responsibility for users that utter or behave offensively, threateningly, defamatorily, racistly, homophobically, or present any other prejudicial or discriminatory behavior towards other users within our platform. On the other hand, we encourage and solicit our users to report such attitudes to the local authorities of their place of residence. </li>
          <li>GoodGain is committed to improving its services continuously. Still, we make no warranties that our services work properly full-time or contain no defects, errors, viruses, etc.</li>
          <li>GoodGain disclaims responsibility regarding its competitors when they use the platform. We reserve the right not to make any warranties towards players' conduct. </li>
          <li>GoodGain reserves the right to add new features or change some aspects of the platform or its services without notice, by its criteria and time limit.</li>
          <li>Nothing in this agreement associates or establishes a partnership, trust arrangement, fiduciary relationship, or joint venture between a user and GoodGain.</li>
          </ul>
          <br/>
          <p className={classes.paragraph}>
          3. <strong>Account Activity Policies</strong>
          </p>
          <ul style={{paddingLeft:23, lineHeight:'26px'}} className={classes.paragraph}>
          <li>Deposits: The user can make any transactions to its digital wallet in the GoodGain platform app, without limitations of credit value.  </li>
          <li>The users can access the payment and deposit methods to add credit to their digital wallets within the app or on our website. Payment methods are dependent on their country of residence. </li>
          <li>Each transaction must be done in the secure environment provided by the financial institution in which the user runs a bank account. It means GoodGain has no responsibility for technical problems that may occur in transactions through the bank platform. This rule applies to every transfer you perform on our platform.</li>
          <li>The users can make transfers directly through their bank accounts or through dealers authorized by us to receive remittances from abroad. GoodGain reserves the right not to accept transfers from countries of which jurisdiction forbids our services. </li>
          <li>The users agree it is their responsibility to confirm the destination account and correct typing when moving credit. After transferring successfully, a user should verify his digital wallet on the app or website and follow the instructions to report the transferred amount with the transfer invoice attached to our team. In the invoice, the sender and recipient must be clearly visible, as well as the transfer amount. When GoodGain receives a report, we process the information, and if all data is correct, the credit will be available in the user's digital wallet.</li>
          <li>The only way to use your credit card as a payment method is through GoodGain's website (<span><a style={{color:'#2ea3f2', textDecoration:'none'}} href="http://www.goodgain.gg">goodgain.gg</a></span>) from the customer's exclusive area, which can be accessed by the app login and password. The user must fill in the payment amount and perform the check-out while on the website. The credit card operator is in charge of the transfer process, and once authorized, GoodGain will add the credit value to the user's digital wallet. The user acknowledges and accepts the credit card operation may not be automated and that GoodGain is just the credit value recipient. It means GoodGain relies on time limits proposed by credit card operators. </li>
          <li><strong>Withdrawals</strong> â€“ Withdrawal request: The user is the only one who owns the credit value, deposited or acquired, in the digital wallet of his GoodGain account. The users can request transfers to their bank account once they are opened in their country of residence as long as they own a positive balance available to be requested.</li>
          <li>The users agree that any amount of credit available in their digital wallet can only be transferred to a bank account under their legal name and property, and no other means. GoodGain reserves the right only to accept withdrawal and transfer requests from those who have their bank accounts corresponded to their registration data in their GoodGain accounts.</li>
          <li>The users agree they can only request transferals or withdrawals from their digital wallets once a week, based on the assumption that the week starts on Monday at 00:00 AM and finishes on Sunday at 11:59 PM. GoodGain will generally process the request within five business days. Due to some time limit required by payment processor companies and bank institutions, some days can be added to the process.</li>
          <li>There isn't a limit value for credit activity as long as the amount informed is available in the user's digital wallet. There is the exception of gift vouchers, which only allow you to add credit to your digital wallet, respecting its value. Gift values offered by vouchers may be increased in certain events as an "incentive voucher", and these changes will be informed. Vouchers are incentives for users to benefit from adding credit to their wallets with discounts, which means no voucher value can be withdrawn before the user deposits the same or upper value of the voucher utilized.</li>
          <li>GoodGain reserves the right to temporarily or permanently suspend any users' account access in case of violation of any terms of service, use, or policies proposed and described in our terms. Proven fraud or disrespectful actions towards games' rules and regulations are reasons for your account to be suspended temporarily or permanently. In case an account is suspended, no user has the means to access the credit in it, which means permanently suspended users won't be able to withdraw the credit value in their digital wallets.</li>
          <li>Any payment must be accomplished with the currency of the user's country of residence.</li>
          </ul>
          <br/>
          <p className={classes.paragraph}>
          4. <strong>Services â€“ General Definitions and Values</strong>
          </p>
          <ul style={{paddingLeft:23, lineHeight:'26px'}} className={classes.paragraph}>
          <li>GoodGain organizes tournaments and quick matches and works to gather users willing to play the same game under the same rules and award conditions. These terms are specified in a safe environment protected by technologies and reliable standards provided by the GoodGain app. GoodGain is in charge of demanding compliance from its users towards its rules, finding players who have agreed to the terms, and guaranteeing the competitions to happen transparently and securely. Based on these services (organizing matches and tournaments, managing a technological platform proper to competitions, finding players to compete, and much more.), GoodGain calculates and establishes fees that pay for their efforts towards the gamer community.</li>
          <li><strong>Quick Matches</strong>
          <ul style={{paddingLeft:23}}>
          <li>Quick matches are performed between two players or teams. Only one game is its proposition, requiring no other stage or match to proclaim the winner unless there are events that require more than one game. The games happen quickly, and the winner is confirmed once the game is over. Then, the game developer company will make the official announcement. The users select the game they'll play, the value for a room (the amount of credit they want to receive in case of victory) and submit to GoodGain, so we can try to find a user playing by the same conditions. With our algorithm, we search for a random user who complies with the requirements, promote the match, and give both players the support to create a quick match. We also guarantee the rules are being followed by both players, interfere in personal confrontation, estimate the final result, and generate the credit activity with the amount established to the winner's wallet. The games are played by the users' consoles and within the game developers' servers. That means GoodGain has no means to interfere with the game results.</li>
          <li>A percentage fee is charged every quick match to pay for GoodGain services. The price for quick matches costs 20% of each user's amount to participate in the competition and utilize GoodGain services. GG reserves the right to modify its criterion and match duration, as well as the cost of service fees. Any changes will be updated in this agreement.</li>
          </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Online Tournaments</strong>
          <ul style={{paddingLeft:23}}>
          <li>Online tournaments, described simply as "tournaments", usually occur in a single-elimination format and involve from 2 to 16 teams or participants. The tournaments may start from the round of 16, quarter-finals, semi-finals, or even finals if the number of players/teams is lesser than the maximum limit. The bracket is created randomly and automatically which means GoodGain has no power to interfere in the competition.</li>
          <li>GoodGain is paid for its organization and management services by a percentage tax that costs 31,25% of the enrollment fee. This value is estimated based on the cost to enroll in a tournament and benefit from the management services. GoodGain reserves the right to change its criterion and duration and alter the tax value without notice. Any change will be described in this agreement.</li>
          <li>Subscribing yourself or your team in a tournament implies that you and your teammates agree to the tournament rules published on the tournament overview page, with no exceptions. It's your responsibility to read, interpret, and contact the user's support if needed further information</li>
          <li>You and your possible teammates accept that GoodGain reserves the right to change and modify any rules of a tournament at any time before its official start without notice. You also agree it's your own responsibility to check for the rules and regulations updated before each tournament you take part in starts.</li>
          <li>There can be tournaments that long a whole day.</li>
          <li>The user is aware that GoodGain will revise all matches contested and nullify any game if there is any proven violation of these terms or the tournament rules. It relies entirely on GoodGain and its collaborators to invalidate a competition or a match, communicate the participants, and arbitrate the prize. The user declares to recognize Good Gain's authority over the prize issue and accepts a possible refusal to deliver the rewards, as well as the inscription fee, in case of violation of terms.</li>
          </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Ranking and Awards</strong>
          <ul style={{paddingLeft:23}}>
          <li>The ranking feature we provide isn't charged, which means the users do not need to pay in order to participate or use the service. This system is another competition resource we provide to our users, who receive awards if they are on the top of the ranking by the end of the monthly ranking cycle. The awards are not mandatory and permanent, which means GoodGain reserves the right to make changes, discontinue or even cancel the award for a particular month or period. Besides, GoodGain reserves the right not to take responsibility for the quality or delays related to the shipping and delivery process of products we send as a form of awards. It is neither GoodGain's responsibility to provide any support between the award-winning user and the provider company. An invoice will be sent in the user's name so they can deal with any problems in the process on their own.</li>
          </ul>
          </li>
          </ul>
          <br/>
          <p className={classes.paragraph}>
          5. <strong>Unacceptable Behavior</strong>
          </p>
          <ul style={{paddingLeft:23, lineHeight:'26px'}} className={classes.paragraph}>
          <li><strong>Personal Use:  </strong>GoodGain's services are only provided to those who create their accounts, which means the users accept to benefit from it as for personal use, and not share it with anyone else. GoodGain owns mechanisms to identify attempts to break the rules and infringe the system standards.</li>
          <li><strong>Collusion:  </strong>it is strictly forbidden to act in collusions, especially between users. An attempt to get advantages in exchange for favors is considered illicit behavior against acceptable competitive practices. Any attempt to manipulate results, simulate performance, and any other possible forged situation to benefit a single user or team and fraud an official result will be considered a violation of these terms. It means GoodGain can banish any user involved in this kind of scheme. To avoid such a situation, we encourage and solicit users to denounce and report when they notice such a thing.</li>
          <li><strong>Fraud: </strong>GoodGain declares in these terms that the company does not tolerate any fraudulent act, cheat (or attempt to), dishonesty, or improper conduct towards our systems and services. We will take action and deposit efforts to punish any user involved with illicit acts or schemes through our fraud department. Not only strict to a competitive environment, but we will take action in other areas too. Any attempt to use stolen credit cards, laundered money, or even utilize your GoodGain account not to compete in compliance with our systems will be rigorously penalized within our platform, and most probably out of it as well. We may report any illegal activity to authorities, cooperate with investigations, and provide all support to litigations towards any user.</li>
          </ul>
          <br/>
          <p className={classes.paragraph}>
          6. <strong>Breach</strong>
          </p>
          <ul style={{paddingLeft:23, lineHeight:'26px'}} className={classes.paragraph}>
          <li>Any action from the user that lacks compliance with any part of these terms is considered a breach of our agreement. The user agrees to indemnify, defend, and exempt GoodGain and their shareholders, directors, and employees from claims, liability, losses, damages, and expenses, including the costs of advocate hours and any other charges that might arise from the following situations:</li>
          </ul>
          <p className={classes.paragraph}>â€“ A breach from the user regarding these terms of use and services.</p>
          <p className={classes.paragraph}>â€“ Violation from the user regarding laws or third-party rights.</p>
          <p className={classes.paragraph}>â€“ Violation from the user regarding the local jurisdiction of the user's country of residence.</p>
          <br/>
          <p className={classes.paragraph}>
          7. <strong>Account Management and Security</strong>
          </p>
          <ul style={{paddingLeft:23, lineHeight:'26px'}} className={classes.paragraph}>
          <li>To benefit from our services, any user can only own a single account, which means it's strictly forbidden to create new accounts. In case the user violates this part of the agreement, and GoodGain's team becomes aware of the breach, the user's account can be instantly deleted, and the user will have no access to any credit kept in the digital wallet.</li>
          <li>The user is the only person in charge of creating his password and managing his account securely. To comply with good practices, the user should maintain it <strong>safe and confidential.</strong></li>
          <li>It is the users' responsibility to keep their login and password safe and confidential. There cannot be a single third-party logging into your account without our team's permission. Any third-party login will be considered an unauthorized login for personal use and benefit, which means the user breaches this agreement by allowing a third-party to use his account. </li>
          <li>It is the users' responsibility to meet the payment deadlines defined in the payment terms. The users are in charge of contacting our customer service if they are unsure about the payment deadlines or any other payment term.</li>
          <li>GoodGain reserves the right to utilize electronic payment processors or third-party financial institutions to process any payment from you or to you.</li>
          <li>Inactive accounts: If an account keeps being not used after 12 months, GoodGain reserves the right to contact the user who owns it to credit any value available back to his account. </li>
          <li>If an account is inactive, GoodGain reserves the right to end it at any time without notice. Any balance available will be credited back to the owner's registered bank account in our database.</li>
          <li>A user can require his account to be closed by accessing GoodGain customer support at any time. GoodGain will end the account and delete all data related to the user from the database.</li>
          </ul>
          <p className={classes.paragraph}>
          8. <strong>Governing Law</strong>
          </p>
          <p className={classes.paragraph}>The laws of South Australia shall govern these terms and agreements.
